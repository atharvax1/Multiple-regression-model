 ðŸ“Š Multiple Linear Regression Model

This project demonstrates a Multiple Linear Regression model built using NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, trained and tested on Google Cloud.

# ðŸ”§ Features

* Implemented using core Python libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, and `Matplotlib`
* Handled both numerical and **categorical data** using **One Hot Encoding**
* Trained on a real-world dataset to predict outcomes based on multiple features
* Visualized results to understand model behavior and accuracy
* Achieved a **decent level of prediction performance** â€” still room for optimization and learning!

# ðŸ§  Skills Applied

* Linear Regression fundamentals
* Data preprocessing & encoding
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Cloud-based model development (Google Cloud Platform)

# ðŸš€ Next Steps

* Improve model performance with feature scaling & regularization
* Experiment with alternative regression models
* Deploy the model via a simple web app (coming soon!)
